This study explores using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to automate the classification of brain hemorrhages from CT scan images, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Trained on a comprehensive dataset, the RNN model effectively distinguishes between hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic cases, significantly reducing diagnostic time. The results indicate that RNNs can provide reliable support to radiologists, improving early detection and classification of brain hemorrhages. Integrating RNNs into diagnostic workflows can advance patient care by facilitating swift and accurate diagnoses.
